- ## Santiago [[README]] V 1.2
	- This page is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with me, especially people who haven’t worked with me before. 
	  It’s also a well-intentioned effort at building some trust by being intentionally vulnerable, and to share my ideas of a good working relationship to reduce the anxiety of people who might be on my team.

	  Please feel free to send me comments or advice regarding this document.
	  
	- ## About me

		- Hi! I'm Santiago, IT Americas / Data & Analytics Manager. My pronouns are he/they, meaning that you can refer to me as “he/his” or as “they/them” depending on your personal preference.
		- You can call me "Santi" or "San".
		- I am Argentine, I have never had the opportunity to live in another country (...yet, I am not closed to moving). [Buenos Aires](https://goo.gl/maps/QosYtGbMf3FmxVDM8) is the city where I live rigth now and it is a beautiful city!
		- I really enjoy playing with my three children, my daughter (the princess of the house), and the twins (the bodyguards), who turned my life around, my priorities, teach me and surprise me every day.
		- I recently rediscovered skiing (thanks to my friends) and it really is something I really enjoy. Being in the middle of the mountain, enjoying the view, feeling the wind and the snow under my feet, really connects me with nature and at the same time disconnects me from all the city and mental noise.
		- Other activities/sports that I like are swimming, Ashtanga Yoga and Tai Chi
		- I really like listening to music and I like going to concerts, my favorite genre is Reggae
		- Movies that i like:  Star Wars, The Lord of the Ring, The Matrix, Fight Club, The Avengers, Ex Machina and mostly sience fiction
		- Series that i like: Lost, Fringe, TWD, GOT, IT Crowd, BBT, Silicon Valey
		
	- ## How you can help me
	  	  
		- I love positive feedback. If I make a mistake please let me know as soon as possible in a direct way. I will really appreciate it
		- I'm open minded, let's share ideas
		- Communicate - I want to do everything I can to help you, but I can’t do it if I don’t know what you need or what I'm doing wrong.
		- I interpret silence as "everything is fine", if that's not true, please reach out to me.
		
	- ## My working style
	  
		- My typical working hours are from 8-10 to 17-19 (UTC-3, Argentina Time) hours, and I try to take one hour to lunch between 12 and 15 hours, however, I am always available to adjust my schedule or attend meetings outside of those hours if needed and notice is given.
		- I like to focus on one thing at a time, so I turn off notifications for email and Teams. Please expect my responses to be asynchronous and I’ll respond when I have time.
		- I consider collaborate with colleagues one of my priorities, so I will, if at all possible, respond to most of the topics that need a response within a working day. If I haven't responded in some manner within a couple of working days, I've likely lost/missed it and may need another prompt (and will be happy to receive it).
		- I like helping others, please let me know if you need some help, you won't interrupt me, I'll be happy to help
		- Unless specifically mentioned, I don’t expect immediate responses from anyone. I respect others’ time and want you to have the space for a thoughtful response.
		- I am not good at providing negative feedback and will need help to get better at it.
		
	- ## What I assume about others
	  
	  	- That they are well-intentioned and honest.
		- You have my trust and respect until you give me a reason to doubt it. I believe everyone works at Loreal for a reason and is 100% capable of doing their jobs.
		- You have a life outside of work that should be prioritized and respected. Work is absolutely not the most important thing in your life. I assume that there are cherished relationships and personal interests that are more important to your happiness, and it’s hard to be happy with your job when work detracts from those things.
		
	- ## Communicating with me
		
		- Teams: Preferred tool. [Chat with me](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/chat/0/0?users=santiago.scutari@loreal.com&topicname=Chat), @ me with some context (something more than a "Hello") so I can understand why you are contact me. Even is a "chat tool" do not expect to have an imedite answer from me. For inemdiate answer use the call method.
		- Teams Call: If we have too much back-and-forth via messaging we should switch to a Teams call to speed things up
		- Email: for more formal communication or for a wide audience. For inemdiate answer use the call method.
		- Book me a meeting: Yo can book [HERE](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/Booking@loreal.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/) ... try please at least 48hs in advance and share the agenda beforehand. I like to be able to come prepared to discuss the topics.My calendar is viewable  and my daily and long-term availabilities are up to date, so feel free to schedule a meeting without asking, as I will move if I cannot accomodate your original time/date.
		- Service Now: for demands or incident, is the best way to track everything.
		- Phone Call: If its an emergency or there is a realy near deadline.
		
		When I am on PTO, I typically do not check in on email or Teams and try to truly disconnect.  If something is urgent while I'm on PTO, please call me.
		
	- ## Strengths/Weaknesses
	  	  
		- Collaborating across teams.
		- I can be… optimistic, when committing to deadlines
		- I jump to solution-oriented thinking quickly, sometimes before having enough context and requirements.
		- Building a team / bringing people together to work on a common goal
		  Not afraid to learn something new or make changes to existing processes
		- Enjoy coming up with process improvement ideas / brainstorming ways to make things better
		- Procrastinating things I think are going to be “too hard”, that normally end up being really easy.
